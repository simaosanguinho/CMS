# CMS: Candidates Management System (DMS)

This repository contains my implementation of the **CMS: Candidates Management System**, developed as part of a recruitment process for the DEI (Department of Informatics Engineering) at IST (Instituto Superior TÃ©cnico). This project was completed to fulfill the requirements of the **BL121/2024** practical exercise.

## Project Overview

The **Candidates Management System (CMS)** is a subsistema developed to facilitate the management of candidates applying for DEI scholarships. The CMS is a module within the broader DEI Management System (DMS), a platform used internally by DEI staff.

### Key Features

The CMS provides the following functionalities:

1. **Candidates Management**:
   - View all candidates in a quick-access table displaying at least their name and IST ID.
   - Add new candidates.
   - Update and remove existing candidates.
   - View all scholarships a candidate has applied for.

2. **Scholarships Management**:
   - View all scholarships in a quick-access table displaying at least the scholarship ID, start date, and end date.
   - View detailed information on a specific scholarship, including start date, end date, monthly value, and enrolled candidates.
   - Add new scholarships.
   - Update and remove existing scholarships.
   - Enroll and unenroll candidates in existing scholarships.

3. **Evaluation Management within Scholarships**:
   - Evaluate candidates based on categories like "Curricular Assessment," "Interview," and "Practical Exercise."
   - Adjust the weight of each evaluation category within a scholarship.
   - Calculate and display the final average score for each candidate based on the assigned grades and category weights.
   - Select the winning candidate(s) once evaluations are completed.

### Technologies Used

- **Backend**: Spring Boot v2
- **Frontend**: Vue.js v3

### Additional Features

While the core features above were prioritized, I also implemented some additional features to enhance the user experience, such as a dashboard for statistics and a homepage for easy navigation.

### Implementation Notes

- The project was developed modularly, with a focus on clean, maintainable code and a user-friendly web interface.
- User input validation is implemented to ensure data integrity and prevent errors.
- Although the current version of the CMS is intended for use only within the DEI staff network, it can be expanded with authentication and authorization mechanisms in the future.
